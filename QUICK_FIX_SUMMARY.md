## 🏗️ Architecture After Fixes

```
Component.ts (loads all JSON models)
    ↓
    ├─ users.json (authentication)
    ├─ employees.json (employee data + manager)
    ├─ skills.json (skill definitions with employeeId)
    └─ projects.json (project data)
    
Employee Dashboard:
    - Loads: model skills + localStorage additions
    - Displays: All employee's skills
    - Can: Add/Edit/Delete skills
    
Manager Dashboard:
    - Loads: model skills filtered by employeeId
    - Displays: All team members' skills from same source
    - Can: View/Search employee skills
```

**Skills Data Path:**
```
skills.json (Default/Master)
    + localStorage (Employee additions)
    = Combined Skills View in Both Dashboards
```

**Manager Data Path:**
```
users.json (Authentication credentials)
    → employees.json (Manager assignment)
    → currentUser model (Login)
    → Employee Dashboard (Display)
```

## ✨ Result

All employees and managers now see the **same skills data**, properly organized with **consistent proficiency levels**, and **manager information displays correctly** throughout the application.

No more SQLite/CSV conflicts. Single source of truth: **JSON Models** ✅
