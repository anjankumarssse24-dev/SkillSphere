# SkillSphere - Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Overview
This document outlines all the issues identified in the SkillSphere project and the fixes implemented to resolve them.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Beginner Proficiency Level Not Saving** ✅

**Problem:**
- When employees tried to add a new skill with "Beginner" proficiency level, the form showed a validation error: "Fill the requirements"
- Other proficiency levels (Intermediate, Proficient) worked correctly

**Root Cause:**
- The `AddSkillDialog.fragment.xml` had mismatched field names:
  - Dialog was using `experience` field but controller expected `yearsExperience`
  - Dialog was using `certification` input instead of proper `certificationStatus` select

**Solution:**
✔️ Updated `AddSkillDialog.fragment.xml`:
- Changed field bindings to match controller expectations:
  - `{newSkill>/experience}` → `{newSkill>/yearsExperience}`
  - `{newSkill>/certification}` → `{newSkill>/certificationStatus}`
- Changed Certification from Input to Select with predefined values:
  - "None" | "In Progress" | "Certified"
- Added `required="true"` to Proficiency Level label for clarity

✔️ Updated `EditSkillDialog.fragment.xml`:
- Applied same changes to maintain consistency
- Used unique IDs to avoid conflicts: `editProficiencySelect`, `editYearsInput`, `editCertificationSelect`

**Files Modified:**
- `webapp/view/dialogs/AddSkillDialog.fragment.xml`
- `webapp/view/dialogs/EditSkillDialog.fragment.xml`

---

### 2. **Manager Column Empty in Employee Dashboard** ✅

**Problem:**
- Employee Dashboard showed an empty "Manager" field in the Profile Information section
- The manager data existed but wasn't being populated

**Root Cause:**
- Employee data was being loaded from localStorage/SQLite instead of the centralized component model
- Manager information wasn't being set when user logged in
- Employee profile didn't have manager field initialization

**Solution:**
✔️ Updated `EmployeeLogin.controller.ts`:
- Verified that manager field is correctly set in currentUser model during login
- Data already properly flows from users.json to currentUser model

✔️ Updated `webapp/model/employees.json`:
- Added manager field to all employee records
- Added email field for completeness

✔️ Updated `EmployeeDashboard.view.xml`:
- Added email display line (HBox4) in Profile Information section
- Manager field already bound to `{currentUser>/manager}`

**Files Modified:**
- `webapp/view/EmployeeDashboard.view.xml`
- `webapp/model/employees.json`

---

### 3. **Skills Data Inconsistency Between Dashboards** ✅

**Problem:**
- Employee Dashboard showed skills from localStorage/SQLite
- Manager Dashboard showed hardcoded/mocked skills based on specialization
- Skills visible to employees were different from skills visible to managers
- No single source of truth for skills data

**Root Cause:**
- Manager Dashboard had a hardcoded skill map:
  ```typescript
  const skillMap: { [key: string]: string[] } = {
      "SAPUI5 Developer": ["JavaScript", "SAPUI5", "SAP Fiori", "HTML", "CSS", "OData"],
      "Data Science": ["Python", "R", "Machine Learning", "Statistics", "SQL", "Tableau"],
      ...
  }
  ```
- Employee Dashboard was using localStorage/SQLite without reference to central model
- No integration between the two data sources

**Solution:**
✔️ Created centralized skills data model in Component initialization:
- Updated `webapp/Component.ts` to properly initialize skills model from `skills.json`
- Added fallback data with all skills properly structured with employeeId

✔️ Updated `webapp/model/skills.json`:
- Expanded skills data to be comprehensive
- Added all required fields: id, employeeId, skillName, proficiencyLevel, category, yearsExperience
- Ensured all three employees have complete skill sets
- Example structure:
  ```json
  {
    "id": "1",
    "employeeId": "EMP001",
    "skillName": "JavaScript",
    "proficiencyLevel": "Proficient",
    "category": "Programming",
    "yearsExperience": 5
  }
  ```

✔️ Updated `ManagerDashboard.controller.ts`:
- Replaced hardcoded `getEmployeeSkills()` mock function with data-driven approach
- Now filters skills from centralized skills model based on employeeId
- Skills now come from the same source as Employee Dashboard

✔️ Updated `EmployeeDashboard.controller.ts`:
- Modified `loadEmployeeData()` to load skills from centralized model first
- Merges model skills with localStorage additions (for new skills created by employees)
- Creates single source of truth while allowing local additions

**Data Flow:**
```
skills.json (Component) 
    ↓
Employee Dashboard ← Loads model skills + localStorage additions
Manager Dashboard ← Loads model skills for all employees
```

**Files Modified:**
- `webapp/Component.ts`
- `webapp/model/skills.json`
- `webapp/controller/ManagerDashboard.controller.ts`
- `webapp/controller/EmployeeDashboard.controller.ts`

### 4. **Unified Database Strategy** ✅

**Problem:**
- Project mixed multiple data sources (SQLite, CSV files, localStorage, JSON models)
- CSV data was used as "default" for manager dashboard
- SQLite used for employee dashboard
- This caused data inconsistency

**Solution:**
✔️ Established **JSON Model + localStorage** as the unified approach:

**Tier 1 - Base Data (JSON Models in webapp/model/):**
- `employees.json` - Core employee data
- `skills.json` - Skill definitions and mappings
- `projects.json` - Project data
- `users.json` - User credentials and roles

**Tier 2 - Runtime Data (localStorage):**
- Used for temporary/session-specific data
- Stores newly added skills/projects by employees
- Persists across page refreshes
- Merged with model data to create complete datasets

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth for default data
- Data consistency across all dashboards
- Easy to seed with sample data
- Simple to extend without backend dependency
- Conflict resolution: Model data + localStorage additions

**Why not SQLite/CSV:**
- SQLite: Complex setup, requires sql.js, adds overhead
- CSV: Only suitable for import/export, not runtime operations
- JSON Models: Simple, built into SAP UI5, easy to maintain

2. Check Profile Information section
3. ✅ Manager field should show: "Alice Johnson" or "Bob Wilson"
4. Email field should display employee's email

### Test Case 3: Skills Consistency
1. Login as Employee (EMP001)
2. Navigate to Employee Dashboard
3. View "My Skills" section - should show: JavaScript, SAP UI5, Node.js, HTML/CSS, SAP Fiori
4. Logout
5. Login as Manager (MGR001)
6. Navigate to Manager Dashboard
7. View "My Team" section
8. Click View on "John Doe (EMP001)"
9. ✅ Employee Details dialog should show same skills as Employee Dashboard

### Test Case 4: Add New Skill and Sync
1. Login as Employee
2. Add new skill: "React" with "Intermediate" level
3. Refresh page
4. ✅ New skill should still be visible (persisted in localStorage)
5. Logout and login as Manager
6. View same employee
7. ✅ New skill "React" may not appear (only model skills), but default skills are consistent
