## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### Issue #1: Beginner Proficiency Level Not Saving ✅

**Severity**: Medium  
**Impact**: Employees couldn't save skills with "Beginner" proficiency level

**Root Cause**:
- Form fields named differently than controller expectations
- Dialog used `experience` and `certification`
- Controller expected `yearsExperience` and `certificationStatus`

**Solution**:
- Updated AddSkillDialog.fragment.xml field bindings
- Updated EditSkillDialog.fragment.xml field bindings
- Changed Certification from text input to Select with predefined values

**Files Modified**:
```
✓ webapp/view/dialogs/AddSkillDialog.fragment.xml
✓ webapp/view/dialogs/EditSkillDialog.fragment.xml
```

**Testing**: Can now successfully add/edit skills with "Beginner" level

---

### Issue #2: Manager Column Empty in Employee Dashboard ✅

**Severity**: Low  
**Impact**: Manager information not visible to employees

**Root Cause**:
- Manager field wasn't populated in employee data model
- Profile section didn't have email field for display

**Solution**:
- Added manager and email fields to employees.json
- Enhanced employees.json with complete manager information
- Profile Information section now displays manager and email

**Files Modified**:
```
✓ webapp/view/EmployeeDashboard.view.xml
✓ webapp/model/employees.json
```

**Testing**: Manager name now displays correctly (Alice Johnson / Bob Wilson)

---

### Issue #3: Skills Data Inconsistency Between Dashboards ✅

**Severity**: High  
**Impact**: Employees and managers saw different skills for same person

**Root Cause**:
- Employee Dashboard used localStorage/SQLite for skills
- Manager Dashboard used hardcoded mock skill map per specialization
- Two completely separate data sources creating conflict

**Solution**:
- Established centralized skills source: skills.json
- Updated Component.ts to load skills model properly
- Employee Dashboard now loads model skills + localStorage additions
- Manager Dashboard now filters from same model by employeeId
- Both dashboards use consistent, unified data source

**Files Modified**:
```
✓ webapp/Component.ts (enhanced initialization)
✓ webapp/model/skills.json (expanded data)
✓ webapp/controller/EmployeeDashboard.controller.ts (unified loading)
✓ webapp/controller/ManagerDashboard.controller.ts (model-driven approach)
```

**Testing**: Both dashboards show identical skills for each employee

## 📊 Code Quality Metrics

### Before Fixes
- ❌ Data inconsistency between screens
- ❌ Form validation errors on valid input
- ❌ Empty required fields
- ❌ Multiple incompatible data sources

### After Fixes
- ✅ Unified data source (JSON models)
- ✅ All form validations working
- ✅ All required data populated

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Data Flow - BEFORE (Problematic)
```
SQLite ── Employee Dashboard (via localStorage)
CSV ──── Manager Dashboard (hardcoded mock)
Result: INCONSISTENCY ❌
```

### Data Flow - AFTER (Unified)
```
Component.ts ── Centralized Model Initialization
   ↓
   ├─ users.json → users model
   ├─ employees.json → employees model
   ├─ skills.json → skills model (UNIFIED SOURCE)
   └─ projects.json → projects model
   ↓
   ├─ Employee Dashboard (model + local)
   └─ Manager Dashboard (model filtered)
Result: CONSISTENCY ✅
```
